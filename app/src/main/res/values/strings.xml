    <string name="about_aupf">Originating from a friendly collaboration between institutions of higher education in China and Thailand, the Asian University Presidents Forum was officially established in 2002 to include higher education institutions across Asia. Since then, the forum has been held annually in different Asian countries and has fostered relationships and cooperation among participating institutions. In fact, cooperation is at the heart of the mission of the forum, whose mission is to “Increase Communication, Exchange Information, Share Experience and Seek Common Development.” Since its inception, AUPF has expanded throughout Asia and has congregated annually in different Asian countries. In line with this, DIU is proud to be the host of the forum in 2019 in Dhaka. DIU management warmly invites and welcomes participants from around the world to the 18 th Asian University Presidents’ Forum to be held in Dhaka, Bangladesh during November 22-24, 2019. This would be an incredible opportunity for the participants to interact and collaborate with other university presidents and leaders.\t
